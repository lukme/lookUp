### Tech

LookUp uses technologies listed below to work correctly:

* [ReactJS]
* [Typescript]
* [SCSS]
* RWD

##### Packages

Also, thanks to their authors, I could use the packages from npm listed below to make development a bit fastier. Nevertheless - for the record - the packages were used only to upgrade aesthetic layer of the app in order to achieve the intended effect while rationalizing the time available for the project.

* [React Zoom Pan Pinch]
* [React CSS Transition Group]
* [React Icons]
* [React Toastify]
* [React Loader Spinner]

### Installation

To run the project locally you have to install the dependencies and start the server. So in the application's root directory run:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Project will run on [http://localhost:3000/].

### Status
Project finished and stable.
